Ultimate parent class of Python - Object class

class MyClass:
    pass

The above code snippet if inherent superclass is not mentioned then it explicitly inherits object class.

class MyClass(object):
    pass

Methods under Object class:

1. __init__(self) - Acts as constructor to create instances of a class
2. __new__(cls) - Allocates memory and creates object
3. __str__(self) - Used by print() to return string
4. __repr__(self) - Returns user-friendly string in the console
5. __eq__(self,other) - Used by == to compare objects
6. __ne__(self,other) - Used by != to compare objects
7. __hash__(self) - Generates hash value for instances that can be used in sets or as dictionary keys.
8. __format__(self,format_specifier) - Controls how objects are formatted by format()
9. __del__(self) - Acts as destructor to delete an object
10. __lt__(self,other) - less than
11. __le__(self,other) - less than or equal to
12. __gt__(self,others) - greater than
13. __ge__(self,others) - greater than or equal to
14. __class__ - Refers to which class the object belongs to
15. __dir__(object) - Returns the valid attributes of the object
16. __sizeof__(self) - Returns size of the object in bytes
17. __getattribute__(self,name) - To access any attributes of the object
18. __setattr__(self,name) - To assign value to an attribute of an object
19. __delattr__(self,name) - To delete the attribute using del keyword
20. __instancecheck__(self,name) - Used by isinstance() to check whether given instance is present

The object class methods form the basic framework for working of Python language.
