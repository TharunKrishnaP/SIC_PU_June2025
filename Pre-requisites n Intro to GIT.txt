--> Go to your Github profile
--> Go to profile setting
--> Go to Developer settings 
--> Generate token (classic)
--> Give a note to remember if accessed later on.
--> Once created, mail the PAT to yourself (optional - for storing it only)

I. Organize files and folders
--> Create a folder named Software to hold installer files of all softwares used.
--> Create a folder named Learning to hold all files, py files etc

II. Git Configuration;
-->  git config --global user.name "{git account name}"
-->  git config --global user.email "{git account email}"

III. Cloning a repo:
--> git clone {repo link}
        repo link syntax : https:// domain name / author name / repo name
		Ex: https://github.com/TharunKrishnaP/SIC_PU_June2025
		  
By running the clone command, we get a copy of the repo in our system.
To use the PAT in the clone command,
Syntax: https://PAT@github.com/TharunKrishnaP/SIC_PU_June2025

PAT will reduce the need of authenticating again and again

IV. Imp GIT Commands:
To update my remote repo w.r.t local repo:
1. Let git create a list of files to be updated [Staging]
2. commit will create objects which are softcopies. Those objects will store the files that need to be updated. Hard copy is present in local repo
3. When given push, those objects are sent to the server via internet.
Only push operation requires internet

1. status  2. commit  3. restore 4.push

--> git status
--> git commit -m "{note}"
--> git push origin main

Git is a multiple thread language.


If you're giving git command to update file:
--> Diff folder : git add {path}
--> Same folder : git add .
